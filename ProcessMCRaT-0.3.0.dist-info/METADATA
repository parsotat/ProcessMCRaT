====================
ProcessMCRaT Library
====================


The ProcessMCRaT library is a collection of scripts that can be used to process the output of the MCRaT code.


About The Project
=================

A collection of python scripts are being developed  in order to aid the general comunity in using the MCRaT code and processing the results of the radiative transfer simulations. These scripts are both tools and examples that can be used or modified to better fit the specific needs of the community. Some portions of the library are specifically compatible with FLASH hydrodynamics files, such as creating movies, however the main utility functions that are meant to process the output of the MCRaT code are complete.

These scripts and the documentation are under development and are still adapting to the developments that are occuring with MCRaT.  While the documentation is being developed, with example jupyter notebooks, the Github README introduces how to use the main utility functions to produce spectra and light curves from the MCRaT outputs.
