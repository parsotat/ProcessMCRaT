# ProcessMCRaT
A collection of python scripts are being developed by Tyler Parsotan in order to aid the general comunity in using the MCRaT code and processing the results of the radiative transfer simulations. These scripts are both tools and examples that can be used or modified to better fit the specific needs of the community.

These scripts and the documentation are under development and are still adapting to the developments that are occuring with MCRaT.
